Clipboard Image Auto Saver is a Python script which monitors the windows clipboard and auto saves image data that changes.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages pywin32, and pillow.

```bash
pip install pillow pywin32
```

## Usage

A batch file is provided to launch and manage the python script.
I did try and user pyinstaller to make a bin file at one point but there was some sort of failure and I don't have time to try and troubleshoot it.
